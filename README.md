# Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer-Prediction

## Problem Overview:
Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. The data that will be dealt with in this problem is the Breast Cancer Dataset of Wisconsin. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

The problem at hand is to predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant.
